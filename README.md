# CNCF_Landscape_DB

## What Does It Do?
This script will pull the CNCF's Landscape data and convert the YAML file to a tabular CSV. 
I wrote this script because I want to eventually be able to use this data programatically or in a dasbhoard. 
My python and data skills are still in their infancy, so any suggestions or improvements are welcome.

## To Do
Explore a more well featured alternative to CSV

Extract the "Extra" sub dictionaries into their own columns

Explore the potential of creating an interactive dashboard

Collect historical data. Currently we only grab the mose recent version of the CNCF Landscape

## How to Use
```git clone https://github.com/AngelGarzaDev/CNCF_Landscape_DB.git && cd CNCF_Landscape_DB
pip install -r requirements.txt && python your_script.py```
