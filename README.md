# CNCF_Landscape_DB

## What Does It Do?
This script will pull the CNCF's Landscape data and convert the YAML file to a tabular CSV. 
I wrote this script because I want to eventually be able to use this data programatically or in a dasbhoard. 
My python and data skills are still in their infancy, so any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
